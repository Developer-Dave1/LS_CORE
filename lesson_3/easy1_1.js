/* 
Will this code raise an error?

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;

This code will NOT return an error. JavaScript will leave empty slots for missing arugments in the index
3-5, and then had the value "5" to index number [6]


BONUS 

let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers[6] = 5;
numbers[4];  // what will this line return?

This line will not return anything, as that index referenced, [4], does not have a value.
